Problem: We all know how we get sucked into youtube algorithm. We start with our intention of spending only 5 minutes on the platform but due to this addictive 
algorithms, we spend way more time than that. I was also not able to watch long videos as I quickly wanted to jump to next recommended video. This was reducing my 
attention span in the long term. 

Solution: I wrote a python program which automatically downloads all the videos of the channels I am subscribed to. The program uses Youtube API to download videos. 
I have scheduled a monthly event when I watch these videos offline. I have found that I have more control over my internet habits while still engaging in content 
i love. 

Next Targets
1. Write a Terminal code which automatically deletes the watched videos. Target Date :31 Jan 2021
2. Make seperate folders for every kind of video downloaded. For me, categories are yoga, productivity, computer science etc. Target Date: 31 Jan 2021
